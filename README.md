## Crunch Time

An Android Application that notifies users when an NBA team that they are interested in is competing in a close game.
The users select: the NBA teams they want to track, the time remaining in the game, and a score difference.
If a tracked team is currently competing in a game in which the score difference and time remaining are less than that which the user selected, 
they are notified.
